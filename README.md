# covid-fears-and-behavior-comparative-analysis
A series of data preps and models that support a project regarding the behaviors exhibited by the citizens across nations. Looks mainly at how fear and perception of importance of actions like wearing masks and following government guidelines effects top-line results

### Method
I will be using Bayesian modeling in rstan to create predictions for theta values for 4 qualitatively determined groups of survey quesitons regarding behaviors and views around covid. I will then use linear regression as the model for these 4 created variables and determine their effectiveness in determining 2 dependent variables, deaths per capita and cases per capita from covid-19.
